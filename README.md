# Dress Up
Dress Up is a React + Django Web Application where users can create and customize a 2D virtual character. This character can be dressed up according to the user's preferences and engages in basic conversation with them. The application is designed to have dynamic interactions, providing comments on the weather and recent news in the user's area. Additionally, the application stores user preferences, such as their favorite color, and refers back to these details in future conversations to create a personalized experience.

# Features
## API Integration
The Dress Up Social Application leverages two primary APIs to enrich user interactions:
1. Weather API: Provides current weather conditions for the user's area. For example, the character might say, “Did you know the weather right now is 53 degrees and cloudy in your area? Make sure to dress warmly.”
2. News API: Retrieves and displays the latest news headlines relevant to the user’s location. The character can inform users about recent news articles and updates.
